Hi! My name is Adam Lee, and I'm currently an undergraduate student at UC San Diego - I enjoy learning about reinforcement learning, deep learning, and web development! Here are some of my values.

### Adventure

I like to try new stuff! New hikes, new technology, and learning are some of my favorites.

### Meeting new people

I love to meet people with different backgrounds and perspectives! Wanna chat? Feel free to reach out to me through my [contact page](/contact).

### Working in teams

Collaboration and support have driven many of my works - I think many great things are impossible without an equally great team!
