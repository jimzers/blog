It's been awhile since I've made a blog post. A lot has happened since then - the COVID pandemic has come, and gone, and come back again (the Delta variant seems to be making media headlines at the time of writing). I'm now halfway through university. I'd like to think I know more than before, but that would be wrong. It seems like there's always more depth to everything...



In attempting to restart this blog, I've began thinking: What have I wanted to post on here in the past?

1. Summaries of papers, books, and concepts that I've read

2. Interviews with interesting people

3. Projects I've been working on



I find the first point to be the most important to my self-development - I would like to get better at explaining things to others. That being said, I haven't posted much of my own thoughts. I don't find myself to be a very opinionated person about many things, but I do meet a lot of interesting people with strong opinions.



Anyways, I'm hoping to make some posts about my more recent projects. Won't try to make high effort posts, but will certainly make an effort to post at least once a month. Some short term topics:

1. Writing the alphabet to boost my GitHub commit history

2. Food

3. Adventures in hardware

4. Experiences in research



On another note, happy birthday to two close friends of mine. Maybe they'll read this blog post?
